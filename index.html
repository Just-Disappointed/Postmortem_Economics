      <h1><br><br> WELCOME TO POSTMORTEM ECONOMICS </h1>

    <p class = "Introduction">
    I am an economist and this is my blog; Postmortem Economics. This is where I
    will write about economics related topics, particularly about the country I
    am from: Malawi.
    <br> <br>
    Why do I do this? <br> <br>


    Find an economist in your life and ask them why they entered this field.
    Half of them (particularly if you pick someone who works in development or
    policymaking) would probably tell you that they were inspired to make
    positive changes in this imperfect world we live in. The other half would
    say that they are in it for the money or job security.
    <br> <br>
    My motives are a little different. You see, I fear a great many things.
    </p>

      <img src="favoriteThings.jpg" alt="Sound of Music Image" width="500">
      <figcaption style="font-size: 14px; color: gray;">Needles and strangers,
        the death of my loved ones. Earthquakes, rejection, insurgencies, rapists.
        Pressure cookers that may blow off my face. These are a few of the
        scariest things.

  I do not think I am alone in this feeling. See, the world is imperfect,
  uncertain and oftentimes unfair. In response to this, it is tempting to make
  decisions that neither benefit you nor those around you.
  One of the things I wanted to be when I was a child was a pathologist because
  I thought that I’d be good at being a person that can take a body (something
  that makes people feel sad or terrible) and extract truth. I am not a
  pathologist. I am an economist. But I still have the same purpose. To
  look at something complicated and often unfair (the world we live in)
  and be one of the people who can help understand what the heck is going
  on so we can all make better choices.
  The thought of this makes me less afraid. Thank you for taking this
  journey with me. I hope it is educational and fun for you too.
