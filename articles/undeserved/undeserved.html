        <h1>A, LIKELY UNDESERVED, DEFENSE OF PUBLIC SECTORS IN A RANDOM WORLD</h1>

        <h2> INTRODUCTION </h2>
        <p class = "Intro1">
          I find farming sims relaxing. You know, those games where you pretend to be a farmer living in a small community. Everything’s cute and fun.

           A common minigame in these is the fishing minigame. It is a game of precision where you have to use your mouse or console to pull and release. If you click too much, you will break the pole. If you click too infrequently, your fish will escape.

        <p class = "intro3">
          In even bringing up the farming sims, I’m procrastinating writing this article. I’ve been doing that for the last month. In a lot of ways, talking about the private sector, any private sector, can feel as precarious and fruitless as trying to catch an imaginary fish. If you’re too anti-government, you look like one of those libertarians who joined the movement in protest of age of consent laws. But you certainly don’t want to be too pro-government. You look like a fresh baby that’s never read Animal Farm.
        </p>

        <p class = "intro4">
          If you’re really poor with your words, you look like both at the same time. And, you know what, that is a risk I am willing to take with this article about the plans governments make and the non-incompetence based reasons why they don’t always work.
        </p>

        <h2> DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY </h2>
        <p class = "devstrats1">
          Say you’re from a financially challenged country.

        <p class = "devstrats2">
          Let us assume that the majority of the people working for your government are doing at least a third of their jobs. Money is scarce and flows unpredictably. Your governments have to create plans on how they will allocate this scarce and unpredictable resource. Your governments also need to communicate these plans in ways that limit social unrest and convince the rest of the world that they know what they’re doing. These are called national development strategies. You can usually find them on their websites.
        </p>

        <p class = "devstrats3">
          Now, if governments always managed to do what they promised, this article would be irrelevant. Now, it is tempting to always attribute these failures to central government circus behavior because you are probably right. However, there are other reasons for these accidents. I want to illustrate the economy and vacation ruining power of macroeconomic shocks.

        <h2> VARIABILITY IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT </h2>
        <p class = "ecDev">
        </p>


        <h2> MALAWI 2063 </h2>
        <p class = "2063">
        </p>



        <h2> MALAWI 2063 </h2>
        <p class = "devstrats">
          The Malawi 2063 is divided into 10 year bite sized implementation plans.
          The first (MIP-1) is a roadmap that Malawi would use to become at least
          a lower-middle income country by 2030. A lower middle income country,
          according to the World Bank, is a country with a gross national income
          (GNI) per capita ranging from 1,146 to 4,515 USD . These are countries
          like Haiti, Pakistan and Zimbabwe (World Bank n.d.). Surely, it was not
          an exhibition of hubris to plan for Malawi to reach the same level of
          economic development as Pakistan, Zimbabwe and Haiti by 2030
          (World Bank n.d.).

          To achieve this level of growth, the people who wrote the Malawi 2063
          calculated that, from 2019 moving forward, the country would need a
          consistent GDP growth rate of at least 6 percent to become a lower
          middle income country by 2030. In my generosity, I calculated 5.75
          percent. Because I love you. Check the appendix for the formula I used.
          While this is a bit ambitious, it was not inconceivable, at the time,
          because:

        <h2> WELL, WHATS THE POINT THEN? </h2>
        <p class = "point">
          I like a good commie trash joke just as much as the next person and I
          am acutely aware of how governments incompe-dance away your tax dollars.

          <figure>

            <figcaption style="font-size: 14px; color: black;">For many of us (you too), this is the national anthem.</figcaption>
          </figure>

          So why have development strategies if you we live in uncertainty and at
          any minute something you cannot predict will disturb all your plans?
          What’s the point if you don’t really believe in your government? What’s
           the point of doing anything? Why train for a marathon if your roommate
           might hit you with their car and paralyze you? Everything we do is
           shadowed by uncertainty and risk. You can at least hedge your bets if
           you have some sort of plan. Even if it doesn’t work, it gave you a
           direction to start from and a place to question yourself if the
           progress doesn’t happen. It is also important to consider that there
           are steps responsible governments can take to hedge their bets. Steps
           like investments in clean technology and getting support from
           organizations like MIGA and the IMF.
        </p>

        <h2> WHAT ABOUT 2063?</h2>
        <p class = "wat2063">
          I almost forgot about that. I’m sure you did too because 2063 is so
          far into the future that unless Malawi has a years-long civil war, it
          should at least be a lower middle income country by then. To be a
          lower middle income country by 2063, it would need an annual growth
          rate of 1.7 percent until 2063. It is unlikely that the growth rate
          will remain that low. There’s even hope for the country to become an
          upper middle income country by then. According to the generous version
          of my calculation, Malawi would need a steady annual growth rate of
          approximately 5 percent to be an upper middle income country by 2063.
        </p>


        <h2> APPENDIX </H2>
        <p class = "appenndix">
            <ul>
              <li>Where did I get my data? </li>
              I used data from the World Development Indicators (WDI) from the
              World Bank. The GDP estimates in the world development indicators
              are slightly different from those recorded in the Malawi Annual
              Economic Report and the IMF World Economic Outlook. This is
              because these and the Malawi government are all different
              institutions using separate parameters for their estimates.
              Fortunately, the numbers are all very similar. I like the use the
              WDI because they’re easily accessible.


              <li>How does this equation work? </li>
              I borrowed a compounding equation from the accountants and finance
              folks and used it to reverse engineer the growth rate Malawi would
              consistently need, based on a year, to become a lower middle income
              country.

              <figure> </figure>

              I used the GNI growth rate as a proxy for the GDP growth rate.
              I explain why below.

              <li>Why did I use GDP as a proxy for GNI? </li>
              Both of these variables are indicators of an economy’s productivity
              but with slight differences. The gross domestic product (GDP) measures
              all that is produced within an economy. The gross national income
              (GNI) measures all that is produced by residents of Malawi
              (even those outside of Malawi) minus what is produced by
              non-residents within Malawi). In Malawi’s case, the GDP and
              GNI are quite similar with the GNI consistently being slightly
              higher.

              Because of this, I am assuming the growth rate we found for the
              GNI is the same one we would need for the GDP to facilitate the
              economic growth we are looking for.
