        <h1>THE MONETARY POLICY TRANSMISSION MECHANISM: IS IT IN THE ROOM WITH US?</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p class = "Introduction">

          Remember that article when I calculated the correlation between
          Malawi’s CPI and interest rate in argument for the presence of a
          significant monetary policy transmission mechanism and then
          subsequently stated that this was a weak argument?
          <br>
          Well, this is the next step in the iterative journey that is research:
          a linear regression.

        <p class = "Data">
          The cool thing about Malawi is that our central bank has been collecting data on
          the policy rate since the 90s! We also have CPI data ranging until the 2000s which is less
          exciting but still good to see. Both are available on their website.
          <br>
          Correlations! We win! Now, let’s go home and wait for the confirmed second season of Dungeon Meshi!

        <h2>A SIMPLE CORRELATION</h2>

        <p class = "Cor1">
          The positive correlations between these variables implies a relationship, which we want to see. The absence of this implies that the policy rate and inflation have nothing to do with each other.

        <p class = "Cor2">
          It’s even better for the policy rate and interbank rate. Its positive looking correlation implies that raising the policy rate will also raise the interbank rate.

        <h2>A PROBLEM WITH SIMPLE CORRELATIONS</h2>
        <p class = "CorBad">
          But wait. You might have some questions.
          <ul>

              <li>Whether this is a real correlation or a coincidence (are inflation and policy rate just moving in the same direction) </li>
                  <center>“Hey Spreadsheet Woman, so do you also think sunspots make banks fail”</center>
                  Correlation can only tell us that there is a linear relationship between two variables. Correlations cannot   tell us which article causes the other. It also cannot tell us if the articles actually have a relationship or if its spurious.
              <br>

              <li>The direction of the relationship (whether inflation influences the policy rate or the policy rate influences inflation)</li>
                  <center>“Hey Spreadsheet Woman, why are all the correlations positive?”</center>
                  A linear regression can help us find the direction of the correlation, which causes the other and the time period. In a simple correlation, this information is muddied.
              <br>

              <li>The magnitude of the impact and whether this is positive or negative (even if policy rate influences inflation, does it do so to a degree that even matters?)</li>
                  <center>“I could have told you this and I interned at a bank for six months!”</center>
                  Yes, good for you. But a regression can give us a numerical value at the margin to measure the degree that these variables influence each other. This is what makes the social a science.
