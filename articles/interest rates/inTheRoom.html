        <h1>THE MONETARY POLICY TRANSMISSION MECHANISM: IS IT IN THE ROOM WITH US?</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p class = "Introduction">

          Since 2019, people in Malawi have been very concerned with inflation and by extension the central bank’s role in controlling it.
          Anecdotally, the credibility of the RBM’s monetary policy, among Malawians, has been diminishing in recent years and many people have questioned its policy choices. A common argument is the following:

          <center>“If monetary policy is not effective in Malawi, then why raise interest rates and discourage borrowing and investment?”</center>
          <br>
          People’s distrust comes from at least three valid sources:

          <ul>
                <li>	At the best of times, the monetary policy transmission mechanism is
                  difficult to measure. This is particularly the case in low income countries
                  which have conditions like underdevelopment in their financial sectors,
                  particularly, in low income countries with a comparatively underdeveloped
                  financial sector. </li>
                <li>	The second is that there is a direction of research into monetary policy
                  in Malawi arguing that the monetary policy transmission mechanism is not
                  strong.</li>
                <li>	Third, there have been periods in Malawi’s economic history where there is evidence
                   of fiscal dominance through the extensive rates of public sector domestic borrowing.
                   Such can confound the impacts of contractionary monetary policy.</li>
          </ul>

          So, there are disputes concerning the role of central bank in Malawi’s inflation.
          I, however, disagree and I with back up my evidence with data.

        <p class = "Data">
          The cool thing about Malawi is that our central bank has been collecting data on
          the policy rate since the 90s! We also have CPI data ranging until the 2000s which is less
          exciting but still good to see. Both are available on their website.
          <br>
          Correlations! We win! Now, let’s go home and wait for the confirmed second season of Dungeon Meshi!

        <h2>A SIMPLE CORRELATION</h2>

        <p class = "Cor1">
          The positive correlations between these variables implies a relationship, which we want to see. The absence of this implies that the policy rate and inflation have nothing to do with each other.

        <p class = "Cor2">
          It’s even better for the policy rate and interbank rate. Its positive looking correlation implies that raising the policy rate will also raise the interbank rate.

        <h2>A PROBLEM WITH SIMPLE CORRELATIONS</h2>
        <p class = "CorBad">
          But wait. You might have some questions.
          <ul>

              <li>Whether this is a real correlation or a coincidence (are inflation and policy rate just moving in the same direction) </li>
                  <center>“Hey Spreadsheet Woman, so do you also think sunspots make banks fail”</center>
                  Correlation can only tell us that there is a linear relationship between two variables. Correlations cannot   tell us which article causes the other. It also cannot tell us if the articles actually have a relationship or if its spurious.
              <br>

              <li>The direction of the relationship (whether inflation influences the policy rate or the policy rate influences inflation)</li>
                  <center>“Hey Spreadsheet Woman, why are all the correlations positive?”</center>
                  A linear regression can help us find the direction of the correlation, which causes the other and the time period. In a simple correlation, this information is muddied.
              <br>

              <li>The magnitude of the impact and whether this is positive or negative (even if policy rate influences inflation, does it do so to a degree that even matters?)</li>
                  <center>“I could have told you this and I interned at a bank for six months!”</center>
                  Yes, good for you. But a regression can give us a numerical value at the margin to measure the degree that these variables influence each other. This is what makes the social a science.
