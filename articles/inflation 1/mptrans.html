			The Malawian Monetary Policy Tranmission Mechanism: Is It In the Room With Us

				Introduction

			<a

			Inflation is a topical issue in Malawi right now.>

			What do economists mean when they say inflation is a sustained increase in
			price levels. This is reflective of inflation's inevitability. It is external
			 and ongoing, even in healthy economies. The price level will not stop increasing.
			<br>
			In light of this, healthy inflation is when the price level is growing but at
			a slow, steady and predictable rate. Such a rate allows salaries and social benefits
			 to (at least theoretically) grow at a comparable rate which stabilizes the standard
			 of living. Like the rotation of the earth, healthy inflation is barely
			noticeable.
			<br>
			The situation people notice and complain about is when inflation is too high. But what is
			 the threshold at which inflation is too high? While it depends on the country context, there
			 are a couple rules of thumb to consider.

			<h2>1. Growth Prices Are Very Noticeable and Hurt </h2>
			I've been doing a fun little exercise where I have been photographing
			the price of groceries. Compare

			This is noticeable inflation.

			<h2>Level of Inflation Overshoots Forecasts </h2>
			This is easier to assess if the type of monetary policy your government employes
			 is inflation targeting. As an oversimplified explanation, this is when the central
			  bank targets inflation and focuses its resources to keeping it lower. One task that is
				a component of inflation targeting is the regular publishing of mid to long term interest rates.

			While Malawi does not conduct inflation targeting, you are welcome
			to go to the central bank website, reading their
			most recent monetary policy report and making an assessment for yourself.

			<h2>If Monthly Inflation Exceeds 10 Percent </h2>
			A growth rate of about 50 percent tends to be classified as hyperinflation. An
			 amount of more than 10 percent is often considered problematic because of how
			 this amount builds up over time. This can be demonstrated with an example.

			 Lets assume that, this month, a cup of tea at your favorite restaurant costs MWK2000.
			  Let us also assume that monthly inflation is at a manageable 2 percent.
				<br>
				 Note that there are many different subcategories of inflation, not every item
				  in your economy will grow bu the same amount and that the headline Inflation
				is the average of all the inflations. So, based on this, you can predict the price
				 of this tea in six months using this formula:
				 <figure>
				<br>
				b<sub>n</sub> = b<sub>1</sub> + (n-1)<sup>d</sup>
				<br>
				Now with the figures.
				<br>
				<br>
				b<sub>6</sub> = MWK2000 + (6-1)<sup>0.02</sup>
				<br>
				b<sub>6</sub> = MWK2001.03
				<br>
				PRACTICALLY NOTHING
