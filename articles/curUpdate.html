        <h1>THE INTRODUCTION OF THE MWK 5000 NOTE AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR
          MALAWI’S ECONOMY</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p class = "Introduction">

          On the 23rd of November 2021, the Reserve Bank of Malawi announced its
          intention to introduce a 5000 Malawi Kwacha banknote and to upgrade
          the pre-existing 2000 Kwacha banknote. These actions are to be
          implemented on the 24th of February, 2022 (Kalumbi, 2021). This
          announcement was met with concern from the general public. While there
          is much to be concerned about in the larger economic climate, it is
          important to address these concerns and reassure the public. This is
          because an environment of economic anxiety is one that breeds
          misinformation and consumer behavior that ultimately harms those
          engaging in it. Thus, the purpose of this document is to explain
          the purpose of the MK 5000 note and its implications for Malawi’s
          natural economy.

        </p>

        <br>
        <h2>PUBLIC OUTCRY AGAINST HIGHER CURRENCY NOTES</h2>

          <p class = "outcry">
            There was a prevalent assumption that the introduction of this
            currency denomination would lead to unsustainable levels of
            inflation. This is a fear that has been documented in several other
            countries where larger denominations were introduced. These include
            Ghana, Nigeria and Thailand  (Franses, 2006). Additionally, it has
            been assumed, in countries like Poland, that the introduction of a
            new denomination is an attempt by the government to hide evidence of
            corruption, money laundering and similar crimes (Manikowski, 2017).


            <br>

            These concerns are, however, unfounded. It has been empirically
            observed that the introduction of new banknotes does not result in
            inflation nor does not indicate that there will be inflation in the
            future (Franses, 2006).

            <br>

            At worst, the announcement of a higher denomination may create the
            public perception that inflation will take place if the citizens of
            the particular country are not told otherwise. This is because
            consumer behavior, and by extension consumer panic, is a determinant
            of inflation. It is important to note that long term inflation
            resulting from a  redenomination announcement or the introduction of
            a higher currency denomination has not been empirically observed
            (Egbuna & Obikili, 2013).
          </p>

          <h2>UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS ARE HIGHER DENOMINATIONS INTRODUCED</h2>

          <p class = conditions>

                One role of Monetary Authorities and Central Banks is to provide
                banknotes and coins to meet the demand of consumers. Monetary
                Authorities fulfil this role by regularly reevaluating the
                currency in circulation based on several criteria.  On average,
                countries reevaluate their currencies and introduce higher
                denominations every 10 years. Banknotes need to remain resistant
                to forgery in the presence of the current technological
                conditions and the level of criminal activity in the country.
                Banknotes need to be made of a durable and low cost material,
                based on the available cost and technology. The criteria most
                important for this document is that bank notes and coins in
                circulation need to have an optimal denomination structure.
                (Manikowski, 2017).

                <br>

                An optimal denomination structure means that the different
                denominations of coins and banknotes in circulation must be in
                the best combination to facilitate the most efficient
                transactions. A practical example of this, is the one Kwacha
                coin. While this coin is currently in circulation, it is rarely
                used in transactions because its value is very small compared to
                the goods and services on the market. If one decided to pay for
                even a small purchase (a cake worth MK100), it would still be an
                inefficient transaction. This is a symptom of a currency without
                an optimal denomination.

                <br>

                Banknotes organically become less optimal over time because of
                socioeconomic factors that have led to goods in the economy
                having an increased value over time. This is for a combination
                of two reasons. First of all, naturally occurring inflation
                raises the price of all goods and services in the economy. The
                currency denomination needs to increase along with this,
                otherwise banknotes will be too small for efficient
                circumstances. Secondly economic expansion leads to the
                introduction of new and more expensive goods into the economy.
                An example of this is the presence of cars in the market that
                were not available in previous years (Ghana, 2019). The
                optimization of a currency denomination is based on two criteria:


                <ul>
                  <li>1.	Does it minimize the cost of money?</li>
                    <br>
              The cost of money, in this context, has two references. The first
              is the cost on the Central Bank, RBM. When a currency denomination
              is too low, it takes more notes to make a transaction. Because of
              this, the Central Bank has to issue more currency, a process that
              costs taxpayers money (Pattanarangsun, 2011).


                  <li>2.	Does it make cash transactions more efficiently?</li>
                    <br>
              This is the cost faced by stakeholders; including, consumers,
              retailers and commercial banks. When carrying out transactions,
              there is an associated cost. There are several examples of such
              costs. The first is the physical inconvenience of carrying a large
              number of coins or banknotes for a simple transaction. This is
              also the difficulty of counting out large amounts of banknotes
              and the potential for theft and mistakes within these transactions.
              Additionally, this is represented by a loss in the demand for
              banknotes compared to digital transactions. While digital
              transactions are innovative, facilitating them comes with a
              fee, unlike cash payments.

                    <br>

             These costs are made worse by a sub-optimal denomination structure.
             This is because, payments made with an unnecessarily large number
             of coins and notes complicate the transaction. An example of this
             is the inconvenience of counting out the price of a restaurant meal
             using a stack of 20 kwacha notes. This also reduces the demand for
             the currency compared to an alternative one.

                </ul>

          </p>

          <h2>WHY INTRODUCE HIGHER DENOMINATIONS IN A DIGITALIZING WORLD</h2>
              <p class = "digitization">

                While digital monetization represents the future, at present,
                cash is still one of the most common forms of exchange in the
                country (RBM, 2022). This is particularly noted in rural areas
                and in the informal sector which the financial sector has not
                yet penetrated. Cash transactions are also cheaper to facilitate
                than mobile banking and other digital transactions (Ghana, 2019).
              </p>


              <h2>OUTCOMES OF INTRODUCING HIGHER DENOMINATIONS</h2>
                  <p class = "higher">

                    According to the empirical theory, there are three outcomes
                    of introducing a higher denomination to a currency:

                    <ul>
                      <li>1.	A reduction in real demand for money</li>
                          In this case, fewer banknotes will be necessary to
                          facilitate a transaction. This will reduce the demand
                          for banknotes and increase the efficiency of
                          transactions. This is known as the efficiency effect.
                          While this places upwards pressure on price levels and
                          may cause them to rise, it is not enough to create
                          inflation. (Suggestion: how about “it is not
                          equivalent to inflation”?)

                      <li>2.	A demand for real cash relative to digital money</li>
                          The demand for banknotes, as opposed to digital
                          transactions, will increase because the inconvenience
                          associated with physical transactions will be reduced.
                          This is known as the substitution effect which will
                          reduce the pressure on the price level. This also
                          reduces the demand for assets that gain interest. This
                          increases the real balance to income ratio and reduces
                          the opportunity for inflation. This will also reduce
                          the money multiplier effect and reduce the nominal
                          stock of money, reducing the pressure on the price
                          level. (as an economics layman I don’t know the
                          meaning of nominal)

                      <li>3.	An increase in the real flow of income</li>
                          This means that labor and real resources will be saved
                          after the efficiency of transactions is increased.
                          For example, less time will be spent counting money,
                          fewer banknotes will be physically transported and
                          fewer notes will need to be issued. This represents an
                          increase in the demand for money (Egbuna & Obikili,
                          2013).

                    </ul>
                  </p>

                  <h2>HAPPENED</h2>
                      <p class = "happened">

                        The (then) Governor of the Reserve Bank of Malawi, Dr.
                        Wilson Banda, explained much of the decision making
                        behind the establishment of the MK5000 banknote. He
                        stated that according to the RBM Currency Management
                        Policy, high banknotes should not account for more than
                        60 percent of the total value of currency. He then
                        stated that, currently, MK2000 kwacha notes exceed over
                        80 percent of the currency in circulation. This implies
                        that the Malawi Kwacha has a suboptimal denomination
                        structure. All of the banknotes and coins worth less
                        than MK2000 are so inefficient that there is a massive
                        demand for MK2000 notes. Rather than remain with this
                        system, it is sensible to introduce a higher
                        denomination.

                        <br>

                        Additionally, the Governor stated that new MK2000 notes
                        with more security features will be issued alongside the
                        MK5000 notes. This is because this note, being the most
                        in-demand currency, is uniquely vulnerable to
                        fabrication.

                        <br>

                        Thus, the RBM is being proactive in addressing this
                        currency issue and the decision to undertake this will
                        not result in inflation. While the entire operation will
                        cost 2.8 billion Kwacha, this is less money in the long
                        run than what it would cost to issue small banknotes
                        that are not in demand and lead to inefficient
                        transactions.
                      </p>

          <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
              <p class = "conclusion">

                Pretend you are a shopkeeper at a toy store. Your supervisor has
                new items and among them is a Lego set. Not one of those trash
                new sets where its attached to a movie franchise and the model
                has already been built for you. No. It’s the deluxe classical
                XXL box of Legos (1,500 pieces!) in all the colors. You are in
                awe of its beauty. A ten-year-old child approaches you, at the
                counter. She has a suitcase with her. You smile your best
                customer service smile. She points at the Lego set. You tell her
                it’s worth MWK 80,000 . You wonder where her parents are.
                Wordlessly, she opens the suitcase and to your horror, its
                filled with neatly stacked MWK50 notes. She informs you that its
                worth MWK 80,000. A part of your screaming mind wonders where she
                got all that money. You desperately want to take her word for it
                but your supervisor is eyeballing you from across the room.
                Dejectedly, you begin to count. This is one of the many
                challenges faces by people who exist within an economy where
                the currency has an inefficient denomination. Inefficient
                currency denomination can lead to miscounting, fraud, theft,
                difficulty in transportation and general frustration. Thus, when
                a country introduces a new and higher currency, it means that
                this problem has existed for some time and the monetary authority
                is correctly taking responsibility.
