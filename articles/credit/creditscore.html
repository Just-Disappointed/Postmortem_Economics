      <h1>IN (RELUCTANT) DEFENSE OF CREDIT SCORES</h1>
      <br>
      <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
      <p class = "intro">
      I read a lot of 1960s antiestablishment fiction as child and teenager
      instead of playing outside. During this time, I internalized that credit
      scores are the enemy. This was not an informed opinion because I am from a
       country that does not use credit score.
          <figure>
          </figure>
    I’d like to use today’s article to revise my opinion.
      </p>

      <h2>BASELINE INFORMATION</h2>
      <br>
      <h3>What's A Credit Score</h3>
      <p>
                A credit score is a number banks and lending institutions use to
                decide how to compensate themselves for the risk of lending you
                money. Depending on your country or lending institution, this
                can determine the interest you pay on the loan, the amount (if
                any) collateral (property you give the bank if you can’t pay
                your loan) you pay or the maturity rate  (Thomas, Edelman and
                Crook 2002).

      <h3>But, Why Did They Exist in the First Place?</h3>
