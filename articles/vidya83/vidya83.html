        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p class = "Introduction">

          The 80s was a pretty exciting and dynamic time to be alive.


          <br>
          But why does money hold so much power over us? We, as a species, have
          a vacuum in us that we cannot fill; an eternal desire for stuff.
          Though it is impossible to satiate, we still attempt to do so with
          goods and services. This is economic scarcity [Mullainathan Shafir,
          2013].  While money cannot fill this hole but it can pad the bottom a
          little bit and few of us can resist the lure of legally sourced
          unlimited streaming services.

        <br>
        <h2>THEORY</h2>

          <p class = "Theory">
            But, where did money come from? What facilitated its creation? There
            are a variety of theories developed to answer this question and
            depending on the particular economy being examined, it can be any of
            these answers or a combination of all of them. One is the
            traditional metallist perspective: that money evolved from the
            barter system. To elaborate, as people began to develop larger
            communities, individuals recognized that they had different
            aptitudes for producing different goods and began to specialize.
            This led to a situation where an individual would have an abundance
            of fish but no bread, for example. And someone else would have a lot
            of bread and no fish. They would then exchange the goods they had in
            excess for those they could not easily get on their own. This was
            not a complete solution to the challenges of exchange, however.
            Societies have far more goods than fish and bread. Scenarios can
            appear such as a mechanic with a peanut allergy needing envelopes
            from the only supplier in town who happens to have a driving phobia.
            The barter system would be neither adequate nor practical [Graeber,
            2012]. An alternative theory, the chartalist theory, is that money
            was introduced by societal elites as a way to control markets and
            quantify tributes received by subjects (Baron, Ancient Monetization:
            the Case of Classic Maya Textiles , 2018). This represents an
            alternative economic perspective from mainstream western influenced
            neoclassical economics. [Morris, 2010].


            <br>

            This is where the subjectivist economic perspective comes in.
            Pioneered by Karl Polanyi, it states that monetary systems of
            ancient civilizations, closed economies or indigenous economies
            cannot be directly compared to that of open industrialized nations
            because of the different monetary needs of these societies. Direct
            comparisons would make the smaller economies seem under-functioning
            despite operating in their own right. In its inception, this theory
            was used to as a separation point between modern currencies and
            seemingly primitive and underdeveloped currencies. These ideas have,
            however, been refined though further research and archeology and the
            modern understanding is that monetary systems in precolonial and
            prehistoric societies are now known to be more sophisticated than
            previously assumed.

            <br>

            Accordingly, there are two types of money: general purpose money and
            special purpose money. General purpose money is the standard three
            role currency that is recognized in complex market systems. Special
            purpose money is a currency that has either one or two of these roles
            and can also be used for direct consumption. [Polanyi, Arensberg,
            Pearson, 1957]. At the very least, it needs to fulfil a triangular
            hypothesis would make something be classified as currency. (Jacobson,
            2001). Nontheless, these currencies still deviate from what we view
            as modern money. I will examine this further with examples from both
            precolonial African and Mesoamerica.

            <br>

            In much of central and southern Africa during the iron age, iron and
            copper were widely smelted.  Unlike iron, which iron was used to
            produce purely utility items, copper was used for ceremonial
            jewelry, tools and religious items. Its use was limited to the upper
            class; a predicament that both indicated the social stratification
            in these societies, limited the context in which it could be used
            and increased its inherent value. Copper was made into ingots,
            bangles, rods and crosses depending on its specific purpose and the
            ethnic groups performing this trade. These could be traded for
            subsistence items like food and shelter but also for more specialized
            goods like slaves and ivory. Missionaries and explorers were able to
            use them for trade (Bisson, 1975).

            <br>

            Predictably, the system in West Africa, well over a millennium later
            , was far more sophisticated. In this region from the 16th to 19th
            Century one of the most commonly used forms of currency was the
            cowrie shell. Originating from the Indian Ocean, cowrie shells were
            valued for their exoticism; being unavailable in landlocked West
            Africa. Notably, cowrie shells originating from the shores of East
            Africa were not as valued as those imported from Asia. This created
            a limited supply that facilitated their primary use as a source of
            currency. Slaves and ivory exported off the continent as part of the
            Transatlantic Slave Trade, as well as food, were valued in cowrie
            shells. [Hogendorn Johnson, 1986]. The use of cowries shells as
            currency was so widespread that evidence of its inflation had been
            recorded. It is suggested that this was because the inflow of cowrie
            shells into West Africa grew faster the value of commodities and
            enslaved people being exported outside of the region [Ronnback,
            2017]. Like a lot of modern currency, it did not quickly decay like
            cloth. Thus, they were discovered in abundance in archeological
            sites.

            <br>

            The complexity of ancient South American civilization also
            facilitated the development of complex forms of currency. From the
            first century BC until the crumbling of the empire, the Mayan
            civilization was known for its extensive market system. The Maya
            markets were controlled, maintained and organized by social elites.
            They imposed laws enforcing a code of conduct and restricting trade
            to these markets were in place. Because of this, all traders from
            across the civilization congregated there to trade in a vast variety
            of goods and services. The archeological remains of these markets
            can still be found to this day [Baron, Ancient Monetization: The
            Case of Classic Maya Textiles, 2018]. These currencies were so well
            established that they could be measured in terms of one another and
            were treated as a general purpose currency. Two of the most
            significantly traded goods by the ancient Aztecs were cotton
            textiles and caoco beans. Cocoa beans, in particular, derived their
            value from their use in the brewing of a special beverage only
            enjoyed by upper class citizens, during ceremonial events and as
            offerings to the gods.

          <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
              <p class = "conclusion">

                Ancient societies developed their own forms of currency complex
                enough to enable them to exchange goods and services as
                efficiently as was necessary for the times they lived in. Now,
                these currencies, which were often rare decorative items or
                expensive consumable goods, were never going to be as
                sophisticated as modern fiat money, digital currency and the
                dreaded incomprehensible cryptocurrency. And that’s okay because
                they served their purpose to the extent that they were needed,
                in the same way as bullion and goldsmith receipts in historical
                Europe. The history of money in indigenous societies is not as
                often documented as their western counterparts. It is a shame
                because this information can provide a lot of insight into the
                development of money and economic society around the world.
